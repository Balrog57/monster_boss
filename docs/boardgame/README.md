# Client

Creates a `boardgame.io` client. This is the entry point for
the client application.

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Plain JS**

#### Import

```js
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/client';
```

### Creating a client

#### Arguments

1. `options` (_object_): An object with the following options:

```js
const client = Client({
  // A game definition object.
  game: game,

  // The number of players.
  numPlayers: 2,

  // Set this to one of the following to enable multiplayer:
  //
  // SocketIO
  //   Implementation that talks to a remote server using socket.io.
  //
  //   How to import:
  //     import { SocketIO } from 'boardgame.io/multiplayer'
  //
  //   Arguments:
  //     Object with 2 parameters
  //        1. 'socketOpts' options to pass directly to socket.io client.
  //        2. 'server' specifies the server location in the format: [http[s]://]hostname[:port];
  //            defaults to current page host.
  //
  // Local
  //   Special local mode that uses an in-memory game master. Useful
  //   for testing multiplayer interactions locally without having to
  //   connect to a server.
  //
  //   How to import:
  //     import { Local } from 'boardgame.io/multiplayer'
  //
  // Additionally, you can write your own transport implementation.
  // See `src/client/client.js` for details.
  multiplayer: false,

  // Match to connect to (multiplayer).
  matchID: 'matchID',

  // Associate the client with a player (multiplayer).
  playerID: 'playerID',

  // The player’s authentication credentials (multiplayer).
  credentials: 'credentials',

  // Set to false to disable the Debug Panel
  debug: true/false,

  // Add a Redux enhancer to the internal store.
  // See “Debugging” guide for more details
  enhancer: enhancer,
});
```

### Using a client

#### Properties

The following properties are available on a client instance:

- `moves`: An object containing functions to dispatch the
   moves that you have defined. The functions are named after the
   moves you created in your [game object](/api/Game.md). Each function
   can take any number of arguments, and they are passed to the
   move function after `G` and `ctx`.


- `events`: An object containing functions to dispatch various
   game events like `endTurn` and `endPhase`.


- `log`: The game log.


- `matchID`: The match ID associated with the client.


- `playerID`: The player ID associated with the client.


- `credentials`: Multiplayer authentication credentials for this player.


- `matchData`: An array containing the players that have joined
  the current match via the [Lobby API](/api/Lobby.md).

  Example:

  ```js
  [
    { id: 0, name: 'Alice' },
    { id: 1, name: 'Bob', isConnected: true }
  ]
  ```


- `chatMessages`: An array containing chat messages this client has received.
  Each message is an object with the following properties:

    - `id`: a unique ID string
    - `sender`: the `playerID` of the sender
    - `payload`: the value passed to `sendChatMessage`

  Example:

  ```js
  [
    { id: 'foo', sender: '0', payload: 'Ready to play?' },
    { id: 'bar', sender: '1', payload: 'Let’s go!' },
  ]
  ```


#### Methods

The following methods are available on a client instance:

- `start()`: Start running the client. Connects to the multiplayer
  transport and creates the Debug Panel.


- `stop()`: Stop running the client. Disconnects the multiplayer
  transport and unmounts the Debug Panel.


- `getState()`: Get the current game state. Returns `null` if the client
  still needs to sync with a remote master, otherwise an object:

  ```js
  {
    // The game state object `G`.
    G: { /* ... */ },

    // The game `ctx` (turn, currentPlayer, etc.)
    ctx: { /* ... */ },

    // State for plugins.
    plugins: { /* ... */ },

    // The game log.
    log: [ /* ... */ ],

    // `true` if the client is able to currently make
    // a move or interact with the game.
    isActive: true/false,

    // `true` if connection to the server is active.
    isConnected: true/false,
  }
  ```


- `subscribe(callback)`: Add a callback for every state change.
  The passed function will be called with the same value as returned by
  `getState`. `subscribe` returns an unsubscribe function.

  ```js
  const unsubscribe = client.subscribe(state => {
    // use updated state
  });

  // unsubscribe from the client
  unsubscribe();
  ```


- `reset()`: Function that resets the game.


- `undo()`: Function that undoes the last move.


- `redo()`: Function that redoes the previously undone move.


- `sendChatMessage(message)`: Function that sends a chat message to other
  players. The `message` argument can be a string or you can send objects
  to include more metadata.


- `updateMatchID(id)`: Function to update the client’s match ID.


- `updatePlayerID(id)`: Function to update the client’s player ID.


- `updateCredentials(credentials)`: Function to update the client’s credentials.


### **React**

  // The props that this component receives are listed below.
  // When using TypeScript, type the component's properties as
  // extending BoardProps.
  board: Board,

  // Optional: React component to display while the client
  // is in the "loading" state prior to the initial sync
  // with the game master. Relevant only in multiplayer mode.
  // If this is not provided, the client displays "connecting...".
  loading: LoadingComponent,

  // Set this to one of the following to enable multiplayer:
  //
  // SocketIO
  //   Implementation that talks to a remote server using socket.io.
  //
  //   How to import:

## Lobby

# Lobby

The [Server](/api/Server) hosts the Lobby REST API that can be used to create
and join matches. It is particularly useful when you want to
authenticate clients to prove that they have the right to send
actions on behalf of a player.

Authenticated matches are created with server-side tokens for each player.
You can create a match with the `create` API call, and join a player to a
match with the `join` API call.

A match that is authenticated will not accept moves from a client on behalf
of a player without the appropriate credential token.

Use the `create` API call to create a match that requires credential tokens.
When you call the `join` API, you can retrieve the credential token for a
particular player.

## Clients

<!-- tabs:start -->
### **Plain JS**

boardgame.io provides a lightweight wrapper around the Fetch API to simplify
using a Lobby API server from the client.


```js
import { LobbyClient } from 'boardgame.io/client';

const lobbyClient = new LobbyClient({ server: 'http://localhost:8000' });

lobbyClient.listGames()
  .then(console.log) // => ['chess', 'tic-tac-toe']
  .catch(console.error);
```

### **React**

The React lobby component provides a more high-level client, including UI
for listing, joining, and creating matches.

```js
import { Lobby } from 'boardgame.io/react';
import { TicTacToe } from './Game';
import { TicTacToeBoard } from './Board';

<Lobby
  gameServer={`https://${window.location.hostname}:8000`}
  lobbyServer={`https://${window.location.hostname}:8000`}
  gameComponents={[
    { game: TicTacToe, board: TicTacToeBoard }
  ]}
/>;
```

`gameComponents` expects an array of objects with these fields:

- `game`: A boardgame.io `Game` definition.
- `board`: The React component that will render the board.

<!-- tabs:end -->

## REST API

### Listing available game types

#### GET `/games`

```js
const games = await lobbyClient.listGames();
```

### Listing all matches for a given game

#### GET `/games/{name}`

Returns all match instances of the game named `name`.

Returns an array of `matches`. Each instance has fields:

## Server

# Server

Creates a `boardgame.io` server. This is only required when
`multiplayer` is set to `true` on the client. It creates a
[Koa](http://koajs.com/) app that keeps track of the game
states of the various clients connected to it, and also
broadcasts updates to those clients so that all browsers
that are connected to the same game are kept in sync in
realtime.

The server also hosts a REST [API](https://boardgame.io/documentation/#/api/Lobby?id=server-side-api) that is used for creating
and joining games. This is hosted on the same port, but can
be configured to run on a separate port.

#### Arguments

A config object with the following options:

1. `games` (_array_) (required): a list of game implementations
   (each should be an object conforming to the [Game API](/api/Game.md)).

2. `origins` (_array_) (required): a list of allowed origins for
    [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing").
    
    The list can contain strings or regular expressions, matching the origins
    that are allowed to access the game server. For example, this could be
    `['https://example.com']` if that’s where your game is running. While
    developing locally you probably want to allow any page running on localhost
    to connect. See [Usage](#usage) below for an example.

[cors]: https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options

3. `db` (_object_): the [database connector](/storage).
   If not provided, an in-memory implementation is used.

4. `transport` (_object_): the transport implementation.
   If not provided, socket.io is used.

5. `uuid` (_function_): an optional function that returns a unique identifier, used to create new game IDs and — if `generateCredentials` is not specified — player credentials. Defaults to [nanoid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid).

6. `generateCredentials` (_function_): an optional function that returns player credentials to store in the game metadata and validate against. If not specified, the `uuid` function will be used.

7. `authenticateCredentials` (_function_): an optional function that tests if a player’s move is made with the correct credentials when using the default socket.io transport implementation.

8. `apiOrigins` (_array_): a list of allowed origins for requests to the Lobby API. Defaults
   to the value provided as the `origins` option (which also applies to the socket transport).

#### Returns

An object that contains:

1. `run` (_function_): A function to run the server.
    `(portOrConfig, callback) => ({ apiServer, appServer })`

2. `kill` (_function_): A function to stop the server.
    `({ apiServer, appServer }) => void`

3. `app` (_object_): The Koa app.

4. `db` (_object_): The database implementation.

5. `router` (_object_): The Koa Router for the server API.

### Usage

#### Basic

```js
const { Server, Origins } = require('boardgame.io/server');

const server = Server({
  // Provide the definitions for your game(s).
  games: [game1, game2, ...],

  // Provide the database storage class to use.
  db: new DbConnector(),

  origins: [
    // Allow your game site to connect.
    'https://www.mygame.domain',
    // Allow localhost to connect, except when NODE_ENV is 'production'.
    Origins.LOCALHOST_IN_DEVELOPMENT
  ],
});

server.run(8000);
```

#### With callback

```js
server.run(8000, () => console.log("server running..."));
```

#### With custom Lobby settings

You can pass `lobbyConfig` to configure the Lobby API during server startup:

```js
const lobbyConfig = {
  apiPort: 8080,
  apiCallback: () => console.log('Running Lobby API on port 8080...'),
};

server.run({ port: 8000, lobbyConfig });
```

Options are:

- `apiPort`: If specified, it runs the Lobby API in a separate Koa server on
this port. Otherwise, it shares the same Koa server running on the default
boardgame.io `port`.
- `apiCallback`: Called when the Koa server is ready. Only applicable if
`apiPort` is specified.

#### With HTTPS

```js
const { Server } = require('boardgame.io/server');
const fs = require('fs');

const server = Server({
  games: [game1, game2, ...],

  https: {
    cert: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/cert'),
    key: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/key'),
  },
});

server.run(8000);
```

#### With custom authentication

`generateCredentials` is called when a player joins a game with:

- `ctx`: The Koa context object, which can be used to generate tailored credentials from request headers etc.

`authenticateCredentials` is called when a player makes a move with:

  - `credentials`: The credentials sent from the player’s client
  - `playerMetadata`: The metadata object for the `playerID` making a move

Below is an example of how you might implement custom authentication with a hypothetical `authService` library.

The `generateCredentials` method checks for the Authorization header on incoming requests and tries to use it to decode a token. It returns an ID from the result, storing a public user ID as “credentials” in the game metadata.

The `authenticateCredentials` method passed to the `Server` also expects a similar token, which when decoded matches the ID stored in game metadata.


```js
const { Server } = require('boardgame.io/server');

const generateCredentials = async ctx => {
  const authHeader = ctx.request.headers['authorization'];
  const token = await authService.decodeToken(authHeader);
  return token.uid;
}

const authenticateCredentials = async (credentials, playerMetadata) => {
  if (credentials) {
    const token = await authService.decodeToken(credentials);
    if (token.uid === playerMetadata.credentials) return true;
  }
  return false;
}

const server = Server({
  games: [game1, game2, ...],
  generateCredentials,
  authenticateCredentials,
});

server.run(8000);
```

!> N.B. This approach is not currently compatible with how the React `<Lobby>` provides credentials.

### Extending the server

The boardgame.io server uses [Koa](koajs.com/) and
[`@koa/router`](https://github.com/koajs/router). You can customise the
Lobby API by accessing the router instance, for example to add routes or
to add custom middleware for existing routes. See an example of customising
the entire Koa app [in the Heroku deployment guide](/deployment.md#frontend-and-backend).

#### Add a custom route

```js
const server = Server({ /* options */ });

server.router.get('/custom-endpoint', (ctx, next) => {
  ctx.body = 'Hello World!';
});

server.run(8000);
```

#### Add middleware

```js
const server = Server({ /* options */ });

// Add middleware to the create game route.
server.router.use('/games/:name/create', async (ctx, next) => {
  // Decide number of players etc. based on some other API.
  const { numPlayers, setupData } = await fetchDataFromSomeCustomAPI();
  // Set request body to be used by the create game route.
  ctx.request.body.numPlayers = numPlayers;
  ctx.request.body.setupData = setupData;
  next();
});

server.run(8000);
```

## chat

# Chat

The boardgame.io client provides a basic API for sending chat messages between players in a match using the [multiplayer server](multiplayer?id=remote-master).

The [plain JS client](api/Client?id=properties) and the [React client](api/Client?id=board-props) (via board props) both provide the following properties:

- `sendChatMessage(message)`: Function that sends a chat message to other players. The message argument can be a string or you can send objects to include more metadata. For example, you might decide to include a timestamp along with message text:

    ```js
    sendChatMessage({ message: 'Hello', time: Date.now() });
    ```

- `chatMessages`: An array containing chat messages this client has received. Each message is an object with the following properties:

    - `id`: a unique message ID string
    - `sender`: the `playerID` of the message’s sender
    - `payload`: the value of the `message` argument passed to `sendChatMessage`

  Example `chatMessages` array:

  ```js
  [
      { id: 'foo', sender: '0', payload: 'Ready to play?' },
      { id: 'bar', sender: '1', payload: 'Let’s go!' },
  ]
  ```

### Notes

- **Chat messages are ephemeral and are not stored by the boardgame.io server.** A client only receives messages sent while it is connected to the server. If messages are sent amongst players before another player has connected, the new player will not receive those prior messages. Similarly, if the page is refreshed, any previously received messages will be lost.

- **Only players can send chat messages.** Assuming the match is authenticated via [the Lobby server](api/Lobby), only players are permitted to send messages, which are authenticated using the same logic as other game actions. Spectator clients can receive and view chat messages, but not send messages of their own.

## concepts

# Concepts

### State

boardgame.io captures game state in two objects: `G` and `ctx`.

```js
{
  // The game state (managed by you).
  G: {},

  // Read-only metadata (managed by the framework).
  ctx: {
    turn: 0,
    currentPlayer: '0',
    numPlayers: 2,
  }
}
```

These state objects are passed around everywhere and maintained
on both client and server seamlessly. The state in `ctx` is
incrementally adoptable, meaning that you can manage all the
state manually in `G` if you so desire.

?> `ctx` contains other fields not shown here that games
can take advantage of, including support for game phases and complex
turn orders.

!> Because state can be sent between client and server,
`G` must be a JSON-serializable object; in particular, it must
not contain classes or functions.

### Moves

These are functions that tell the framework how to change `G`
when a particular game move is made. They must not depend on
external state or have any side-effects (except modifying `G`).
See the guide on [Immutability](immutability.md) for how
immutability is handled by the framework.

```js
moves: {
  drawCard: ({ G, ctx }) => {
    const card = G.deck.pop();
    G.hand.push(card);
  },

  // ...
}
```

On the client, you use a `moves` object to dispatch your
move functions.

<!-- tabs:start -->
#### **Plain JS**

You can access `moves` from an instance of the plain JavaScript client:

```js
client.moves.drawCard();
```

#### **React**

Using React, `moves` is provided through your component’s `props`:

```js
props.moves.drawCard();
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

### Events

These are framework-provided functions that are analogous to moves, except that they work on `ctx`. These typically advance the game state by doing things like
ending the turn, changing the game phase etc.
Events are dispatched from the client in a similar way to moves.

<!-- tabs:start -->
#### **Plain JS**
```js
client.events.endTurn();
```

#### **React**
```js
props.events.endTurn();
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

For more details, see the guide on [Events](events.md).

### Phase

A phase is a period in the game that overrides the game
configuration while it is active. For example, you can use
a different set of moves or a different turn order during
a phase. The game can transition between different phases, and turns
occur inside phases. See the guide on [Phases](phases.md) for more details.

### Turn

A turn is a period of the game that is associated with an individual
player. It typically consists of one or more moves made by
that player before it passes on to another player. You can
also allow other players to play during your turn, although
this is less common. See the guide on
[Turn Orders](turn-order.md) for more details.

### Stage

A stage is similar to a phase, except that it happens within a turn, and
applies to individual players rather than the game as a whole.
A turn may be subdivided into many stages, each allowing a different set of moves
and overriding other game configuration options while that stage is active.
Also, different players can be in different stages during a turn.
See the guide on [Stages](stages.md) for more details.

## debugging

# Debugging

### Using the Debug Panel in production

boardgame.io comes bundled with a debug panel that lets you
interact with your game and game clients. When you build your app
for production (i.e. when `NODE_ENV === 'production'`) this is stripped
out from the final bundle.

If you want to include the debug panel in a production build you can
do so explicitly when creating your client:

```js
import { Debug } from 'boardgame.io/debug';

const client = Client({
  // ...
  debug: { impl: Debug },
});
```

### Debug Panel options

You can use the `collapseOnLoad` option to hide the panel by default when the client loads. The `hideToggleButton` option removes the toggle button on the side of the panel which means you can only use the keyboard shortcut to toggle its visibility.

```js
const client = Client({
  // ...
  debug: {
    // ...
    collapseOnLoad: true/false,
    hideToggleButton: true/false
  },
});
```

### Custom metadata in game logs

It can sometimes be helpful to surface some metadata during a move.
You can do this by using the log plugin. For example,

```js
const move = ({ log }) => {
  log.setMetadata('metadata for this move');
};
```

This metadata is stored in the `log` client property and displayed
in the Log section of the debug panel.

### Redux

The framework uses Redux under the hood.
You may sometimes want to debug this Redux store directly.
In order to do so, you can pass along a Redux store enhancer
with your client. For example,

```js
import logger from 'redux-logger';
import { applyMiddleware } from 'redux';

Client({
  // ...
  enhancer: applyMiddleware(logger),
});
```

Doing so will `console.log` on state changes. This can also hook into the [Chrome Redux DevTools](http://extension.remotedev.io/) browser extension like this:

```js
Client({
  // ...
  enhancer: (
    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__
    && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
  ),
})
```

or both

```js
import logger from 'redux-logger';
import { applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux';

Client({
  // ...
  enhancer: compose(
    applyMiddleware(logger),
    (window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__())
  ),
})
```

### Server + Sockets

The Koa-server can be debugged by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable before starting it.
This will give you access to logs of incoming requests as well as the socket.io logs.
To set the environment variable prepend your npm script to run the server like so:

```
DEBUG=* node server.js
```

> NOTE: For various debugging scopes have a look at the [socket.io-docs](https://socket.io/docs/v4/logging-and-debugging/#available-debugging-scopes)

## deployment

# Deployment

## Serverless Options

For one-player or pass-and-play games, you may not need the boardgame.io game
server and prefer to serve an app that runs entirely on the client. If you
don’t need multiplayer features, this can be a lot simpler than getting a
Node.js server deployed.

There are many services that can help deploy a static app, including some that
offer free options like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and
[Render](https://render.com/).

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Plain JS**

If you followed along with the Plain JS tutorial, you can also use Parcel to
build your app for production.

Add a build script to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "parcel build index.html --out-dir build",
  }
}
```

Running `npm run build` will now create an optimised production build in
`/build`, which you can host just about anywhere.

#### Deployment configuration

Both Netlify and Render offer options to continuously deploy the latest version
of your app from a Git repository. These configurations should help you get
up and running with these services.

<details>
<summary><strong>Netlify</strong></summary>

1. Create a new deployment (see [Netlify docs](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/)).

2. Use the following values for the deployment:

  | Option            | Value           |
  |-------------------|-----------------|
  | Build Command     | `npm run build` |
  | Publish Directory | `build`         |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Render</strong></summary>

1. Create a new Web Service on Render and connect it to your project repository.

2. Use the following values during creation:

  | Option            | Value           |
  |-------------------|-----------------|
  | Environment       | `Static Site`   |
  | Build Command     | `npm run build` |
  | Publish Directory | `build`         |

</details>

### **React**

Running `npm run build` in a Create React App project will create an optimised
production build in `/build`, which you can host just about anywhere.

#### Deployment guides

- **Netlify:** See [the guide on how to deploy to Netlify](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#netlify) in the Create React App docs.

- **Render:** See [“Deploy a Create React App Static Site”](https://render.com/docs/deploy-create-react-app) in the Render docs.

<!-- tabs:end -->

## Heroku
[Heroku](https://heroku.com) uses 2 different ways to determine the run command of a node application. It is possible to either:

- Add a Procfile to the project root directory with the following line  
  `web: node -r esm server.js`

- Update the start script in the package.json to  
  `"start": "node -r esm server.js"`

On Heroku, a regular heroku/nodejs buildpack is necessary to build your app which is usually selected by default for node applications.  

### Frontend and Backend
In order to deploy a game to Heroku, the game has to be running on a single port. To do so, the [Server](/api/Server.md) has to handle both the API requests and serving the pages.  
Below is an example of how to achieve that.

First install these extra dependencies:

```
npm i koa-static
```
Then adjust your `server.js` file like this:

```js
// server.js

import { Server } from 'boardgame.io/server';
import path from 'path';
import serve from 'koa-static';
import { TicTacToe } from './game';

const server = Server({ games: [TicTacToe] });
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8000;

// Build path relative to the server.js file
const frontEndAppBuildPath = path.resolve(__dirname, './build');
server.app.use(serve(frontEndAppBuildPath))

server.run(PORT, () => {
  server.app.use(
    async (ctx, next) => await serve(frontEndAppBuildPath)(
      Object.assign(ctx, { path: 'index.html' }),
      next
    )
  )
});
```

The [Lobby](/api/Lobby.md) might be as follows:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Lobby } from 'boardgame.io/react';
import { TicTacToeBoard } from './board';
import { TicTacToe } from './game';

const { protocol, hostname, port } = window.location;
const server = `${protocol}//${hostname}:${port}`;
const importedGames = [{ game: TicTacToe, board: TicTacToeBoard }];

export default () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Lobby</h1>
    <Lobby gameServer={server} lobbyServer={server} gameComponents={importedGames} />
  </div>
);
```

Or, without the lobby, pass the server address when calling `SocketIO`:

```js
import { SocketIO } from 'boardgame.io/multiplayer';

const { protocol, hostname, port } = window.location;
const server = `${protocol}//${hostname}:${port}`;

const GameClient = Client({
  // ...
  multiplayer: SocketIO({ server }),
});
```

### Backend Only
If you only need to publish your backend to Heroku, your `server.js` can be simplified to this:

```js
// server.js

import { Server } from 'boardgame.io/server';
import { TicTacToe } from './game';

const server = Server({ games: [TicTacToe] });
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8000;

server.run(PORT);
```

And your [Lobby](/api/Lobby.md) would now be pointing to your Heroku app URL:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Lobby } from 'boardgame.io/react';
import { TicTacToeBoard } from './board';
import { TicTacToe } from './game';

const server = `https://yourapplication.herokuapp.com`;
const importedGames = [{ game: TicTacToe, board: TicTacToeBoard }];

export default () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Lobby</h1>
    <Lobby gameServer={server} lobbyServer={server} gameComponents={importedGames} />
  </div>
);
```

Or, without the lobby, pass the Heroku app URL when calling `SocketIO`:

```js
import { SocketIO } from 'boardgame.io/multiplayer';

const GameClient = Client({
  // ...
  multiplayer: SocketIO({ server: 'https://yourapplication.herokuapp.com' }),
});
```

## events

# Events

An event is used to advance the game state. It is somewhat
analogous to a move, except that while a move changes
`G`, an event changes `ctx`. Also, events are provided by the
framework (as opposed to moves, which are written by you).

### Event Types

#### endStage

This event takes the player that called it out of the stage
that they are in. If the definition for the current stage
in the game object specifies a `next` option, then the player
is taken to the next stage. If not, the player is
returned to a state where they are not in any stage.

```js
endStage();
```

#### endTurn

This event ends the turn.
The default behavior is to increment `ctx.turn` by `1`
and advance `currentPlayer` to the next player according
to the configured [turn order](turn-order.md) (the default being a round-robin).

This event also accepts an argument, which (if provided)
switches the turn to the specified player instead.

```js
endTurn(); // without argument
endTurn({ next: '2' }); // Player 2 is the next player.
```

#### endPhase

This event ends the current phase. If the definition for the
current phase in the game object specifies a
`next` option, then the game moves to that phase. If not, the
game returns to a state where no phase is active.

```js
endPhase();
```

#### endGame

This event ends the game. If you pass an argument to it,
then that argument is made available in `ctx.gameover`.
After the game is over, further state changes to the game
(via a move or event) are not possible.

```js
endGame();
```

#### setStage

Takes the player that called the event into the stage specified.

```js
setStage('stage-name');
```

#### setPhase

Takes the game into the phase specified. Ends the active phase first.

```js
setPhase('phase-name');
```

#### setActivePlayers

Allows adding additional players to the set of "active players", and
also any stages that you want to put them in. See the guide on [Stages](stages.md)
for more details.

### Triggering an event from game logic.

You can trigger events from a move or code inside
your game logic (a phase’s `onBegin` hook, for example).
This is done through the `events` API in the object passed
as the first argument to moves:

```js
moves: {
  drawCard: ({ G, ctx, events }) => {
    events.endPhase();
  };
}
```

!> Events are queued up and triggered **after** a move.
Any changes you make to `G` will be applied before events are
triggered, even if the event is called first in your move function.

### Triggering an event from the client

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Plain JS**

Events are available inside the `events` property of
a boardgame.io client instance. For example:

```js
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/client';

const client = Client({ /* options */ });

const clickHandler = () => {
  client.events.endTurn();
}
```

#### **React**

Events are available through `props` inside the
`events` object. For example:

```js
import React from 'react';

function Board({ events }) {
  const onClick = () => {
    events.endTurn();
  };

  return <button onClick={onClick}>End Turn</button>;
}
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

### Disabling events

Events can be disabled. For example, you might not want a
player to be able to end the game directly by simply calling
the `endGame` event.

In order to disable an event, just add `eventName: false` to
the `events` section in your game config.

```js
const game = {
  events: {
    endGame: false,
    // ...
  },
};
```

!> This doesn't apply to events in moves or hooks, but just the
ability to call an event directly from a client.

### Calling events from hooks

The events API is available in game hooks like it is inside moves. However,
because of how hooks and events interact, certain events cannot be called from
certain hooks. The following table shows which hooks support which events.

|                    | turn<br>`onMove` | turn<br>`onBegin` | turn<br>`onEnd` | phase<br>`onBegin` | phase<br>`onEnd` | game<br>`onEnd` |

## immutability

# Immutability

The principle of immutability as applied to state changing
functions like moves in [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/)
mandates that they be pure functions. What this means is that
you cannot depend on any **external state**, nor can you have any
**side-effects**, i.e. you cannot modify anything that isn't
a local variable (not even the arguments).

The benefits of architecting a system with this principle are
that you can ensure repeatability (moves can be replayed
over a particular state value multiple times in different places)
and you can do cheap comparisons to check if something changed.

A traditional pure function just accepts arguments and then
returns the new state. Something like this:

```js
function move({ G }) {
  // Return new value of G without modifying the arguments.
  return { ...G, hand: G.hand + 1 };
}
```

?> The example above uses the
[spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) to create a new object.

[boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/) provides a more convenient
syntax by allowing you to mutate `G` directly while using
a [library](https://github.com/mweststrate/immer) under the hood
to convert your move into a pure function that respects the
immutability principle. Both styles are supported interchangeably,
so use the one that you prefer.

```js
function move({ G }) {
  G.hand++;
}
```

?> Note that in this style you do not return the new state.
In fact, returning something while also mutating `G` is
considered an error.

!> You can only modify `G`. Other values passed to your moves
   are read-only and should never be modified in either style.
   Changes to `ctx` can be made using [events](events.md).

### Invalid moves

In both styles, invalid moves are indicated by returning a
special constant. This tells the framework that the current
set of arguments passed in is illegal and that the move
ought to be discarded. For example, you might do this if
the user tries to click on an already filled cell in
Tic-Tac-Toe.

```js
import { INVALID_MOVE } from 'boardgame.io/core';

moves: {
  clickCell: function({ G, ctx }, id) {
    // Illegal move: Cell is filled.
    if (G.cells[id] !== null) {
      return INVALID_MOVE;
    }

    // Fill cell with 0 or 1 depending on the current player.
    G.cells[id] = ctx.currentPlayer;
  }
}
```

## multiplayer

# Multiplayer

In this section, we'll explain how the framework converts your
game logic into a multiplayer implementation without requiring
you to write any networking or storage layer code. We will continue
working with our Tic-Tac-Toe example from the [tutorial](tutorial.md).

### Clients and Masters

A boardgame.io client is what you create using the `Client` call.
You initialize it with your game object (which contains the moves),
so it has all the information that is needed to run the game.
This is where the story ends in a single player setup.

In a multiplayer setup, clients no longer act as authoritative
stores of the game state. Instead, they delegate the running of the
game to a game master. In this mode clients emit moves / events,
but the game logic runs on the master, which computes the next game state
before broadcasting it to other clients.

However, since clients are aware of the game rules, they also
run the game in parallel (this is called an optimistic update and is
an optimization that provides a lag-free experience).
In case a particular client computes the new game state incorrectly,
it is overridden by the master eventually, so the entire setup still
has a single source of authority. If a move accesses state that is not
accessible to the client (for instance secret state), then optimistic
updates may need to be disabled for that move. See the
[secret state documentation](secret-state.md) for more details.

## Local Master

The game master can run completely on the browser. This is useful to set
up pass-and-play multiplayer or for prototyping the multiplayer experience
without having to set up a server to test it.

To do this `import { Local } from 'boardgame.io/multiplayer'`,
and add `multiplayer: Local()` to the client options.
Now you can instantiate as many of these clients in your app as you like and
you will notice that they’re all kept in sync, sharing the same state.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Plain JS**

Let’s update our `TicTacToeClient` to receive an additional `playerID`
option in its constructor. We’ll use this so that each client knows
which player it is playing for.

Then, we’ll update how we create the boardgame.io client, passing
`playerID` and setting `multiplayer` to use the Local Master.

```js
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/client';
import { Local } from 'boardgame.io/multiplayer';
import { TicTacToe } from './Game';

class TicTacToeClient {
  constructor(rootElement, { playerID } = {}) {
    this.client = Client({
      game: TicTacToe,
      multiplayer: Local(),
      playerID,
    });
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
````

Now instead of rendering one client into our app, we’ll render
one for each player ID:

```js
const appElement = document.getElementById('app');
const playerIDs = ['0', '1'];
const clients = playerIDs.map(playerID => {
  const rootElement = document.createElement('div');
  appElement.append(rootElement);
  return new TicTacToeClient(rootElement, { playerID });
});
```

#### **React**

```js

import React from 'react';
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/react';
import { Local } from 'boardgame.io/multiplayer';
import { TicTacToe } from './Game';
import { TicTacToeBoard } from './Board';

  <div>
    <TicTacToeClient playerID="0" />
    <TicTacToeClient playerID="1" />
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

[![Edit boardgame.io](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/boardgameio-dibw3)
<!-- tabs:end -->

?> You may be wondering what the `playerID` parameter is from the
example above. Clients needs to be associated with a particular player
seat in order to make moves in a multiplayer setup. (If a client doesn’t have
a `playerID` it is a spectator that can see the live game state, but can't
actually make any moves.)

```react
<iframe class='plain' src='snippets/multiplayer' height='250' scrolling='no' title='example' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'></iframe>
```

In the example above you can play as Player 0 and Player 1 alternately
on the two boards. Clicking on a particular board when it is not that
player's turn has no effect.

### Storing state in the browser

If you want game state to be saved in the browser using `localStorage`,
you can pass additional options when creating a local master:

```js
Local({
  // Enable localStorage cache.
  persist: true,

  // Set custom prefix to store data under. Default: 'bgio'.
  storageKey: 'bgio',
});
```

## Remote Master

You can also run the game master on a separate server. Any boardgame.io
client can connect to this master (whether it is a browser, an Android
app etc.) and it will be kept in sync with other clients in realtime.

In order to connect a client to a remote master, we use the `multiplayer`
option again, but this time we import `SocketIO` instead of `Local`,
and specify the location of the server.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Plain JS**

```js
import { SocketIO } from 'boardgame.io/multiplayer'

class TicTacToeClient {
  constructor(rootElement, { playerID } = {}) {
    this.client = Client({
      game: TicTacToe,
      multiplayer: SocketIO({ server: 'localhost:8000' }),
      playerID,
    });
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

We also need to make a small tweak to our `update` method.
When using a remote master, the client won’t know the game state
when it first runs, so `update` will be called first with `null`,
then with the full game state after it connects to the server.

In a real implementation you might show a loading spinner to indicate
this, but we’ll just skip our `update` for now if state is `null`:

```js
update(state) {
  if (state === null) return;
  // ...
}
```

#### **React**

```js
import { SocketIO } from 'boardgame.io/multiplayer'

const TicTacToeClient = Client({
  game: TicTacToe,
  board: TicTacToeBoard,
  multiplayer: SocketIO({ server: 'localhost:8000' }),
});
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

Behind the scenes, the client now sends updates to the remote master
via a WebSocket whenever you make a move. Of course, we now need to run
a server at the location specified, which is discussed below.

### Setting up the server

We’ll create a new file at `src/server.js` to write our server code.

boardgame.io provides a server module that simplifies running the game
master on a Node server. We import that module and configure it with our
`TicTacToe` game object and a list of URL origins we want to allow to
connect to the server. Later you would set `origins` with your game’s domain
name, but for now we’ll import a default value that allows any locally served
page to connect.

```js
// src/server.js
const { Server, Origins } = require('boardgame.io/server');
const { TicTacToe } = require('./Game');

const server = Server({
  games: [TicTacToe],
  origins: [Origins.LOCALHOST],
});

server.run(8000);
```

?> See [the Server reference page](api/Server.md) for more detail on
   the various configuration options.

Because `Game.js` is an ES module, we will use [esm](https://github.com/standard-things/esm)
which enables us to use `import` statements in a Node environment:

```
npm install esm
```

We can then add a new script to our `package.json` to simplify
running the server:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "serve": "node -r esm src/server.js"
  }
}
```

We can now run `npm run serve` in one terminal to start the server and
`npm start` in another to serve our web app.
You can connect multiple clients to the same game by opening
your app in several different browser tabs.
You will notice that everything is kept in sync as you play
(state is not lost even if you refresh the page).

This example still has both players on the same screen. A more natural
setup would be to have each client just have a single (but distinct)
player.

<!-- tabs:start -->
#### **Plain JS**

You want one client to render:
```js
new TicTacToeClient(appElement, { playerID: '0' });
```

and another to render:
```js
new TicTacToeClient(appElement, { playerID: '1' });
```

#### **React**

You want one client to render:
```
<TicTacToeClient playerID="0" />
```

and another to render:
```
<TicTacToeClient playerID="1" />
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

One way to do this is to ask the player which seat they
want to take when they open your app and then set the
`playerID` accordingly. You can also use a URL path to
determine the player or use a matchmaking lobby.

Complete code from this section is available on CodeSandbox for both
[React](https://codesandbox.io/s/boardgameio-fsl8y) and
[Plain JS](https://codesandbox.io/s/bgio-plain-js-multiplayer-server-742oh)
versions.
To run the server, you can click **File** > **Export to ZIP** to download
the project, then run the server and client as described
above. Don't forget to run `npm install` in the project directory first!

?> **TIP** You can also set the `playerID` to point to any player while
prototyping by clicking on the box of that respective player on the debug UI.

### Multiple Game Types

You can serve multiple types of games from the same server:

```js
const app = Server({ games: [TicTacToe, Chess] });
```

For this to work correctly, make sure that each game
implementation specifies a name:

```js
const TicTacToe = {
  name: 'tic-tac-toe',
  // ...
};
```

### Game Instances

By default all client instances connect to a game with
an ID `'default'`. To play a new game instance, you can pass
`matchID` to your client. All clients that use
this ID will now see the same game state.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Plain JS**

Pass `matchID` when creating your boardgame.io client:
```js
const client = Client({
  game: TicTacToe,
  matchID: 'matchID',
  // ...
});
```

You an also update a `matchID` on an already instantiated client:
```js
client.updateMatchID('newID');
```

#### **React**

```
<TicTacToeClient matchID="match-id"/>
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

The `matchID`, similar to the `playerID` can again be determined
either by a URL path or a lobby implementation.

### Storage

The default storage implementation is an in-memory map.
If you want something that's more persistent, you can use one
of the available database connectors, or even implement your own.

See [the storage docs](storage.md) for more details.

## phases

# Phases

Most games beyond very simple ones tend to have different
behaviors at various phases. A game might have a phase
at the beginning where players are drafting cards before
entering a playing phase, for example.

Each phase in [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/) defines a set
of game configuration options that are applied for the duration
of that phase. This includes the ability to define a different
set of moves, use a different turn order etc. Turns happen
inside phases.

### Card Game

Let us start with a contrived example of a game that has exactly
two moves:

- draw a card from the deck into your hand.
- play a card from your hand onto the deck.

```js
function DrawCard({ G, playerID }) {
  G.deck--;
  G.hand[playerID]++;
}

function PlayCard({ G, playerID }) {
  G.deck++;
  G.hand[playerID]--;
}

const game = {
  setup: ({ ctx }) => ({ deck: 6, hand: Array(ctx.numPlayers).fill(0) }),
  moves: { DrawCard, PlayCard },
  turn: { minMoves: 1, maxMoves: 1 },
};
```

?> Notice how we moved the moves out into standalone functions
instead of inlining them in the game object.

We'll ignore the rendering part of this game, but this is how it might look. Note that you can draw or play a card at any time, including taking a card when the deck is empty.

```react
<iframe class='plain' src='snippets/phases-1' height='350' scrolling='no' title='example' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe>
```

### Phases

Now let's say we want the game to work in two phases:

- a first phase where the players only draw cards (until the deck is empty).
- a second phase where the players only play cards.

In order to do this, we define two `phases`. Each phase can specify its own
list of moves, which come into effect during that phase:

```js
const game = {
  setup: ({ ctx }) => ({ deck: 6, hand: Array(ctx.numPlayers).fill(0) }),
  turn: { minMoves: 1, maxMoves: 1 },

  phases: {
    draw: {
      moves: { DrawCard },
    },

    play: {
      moves: { PlayCard },
    },
  },
};
```

!> A phase that doesn't specify any moves just uses moves from
the main `moves` section in the game. However, if it does,
then the `moves` section in the phase overrides the global
one.

The game doesn't begin in any of these phases. In order to begin
in the "draw" phase, we add a `start: true` to its config. Only
one phase can have `start: true`.

```js
phases: {
  draw: {
    moves: { DrawCard },
+   start: true,
  },

  play: {
    moves: { PlayCard },
  },
}
```

Let's also end the "draw" phase automatically once the deck is
empty.

```js
phases: {
  draw: {
    moves: { DrawCard },
+   endIf: ({ G }) => (G.deck <= 0),
+   next: 'play',
    start: true,
  },

  play: {
    moves: { PlayCard },
  },
}
```

`endIf` ends the phase that it is defined in when it returns
`true`. The game is returned to a state where no phase is
active. However, for this game, we want to move to
the "play" phase once the "draw" phase is done. We specify a
`next` option for this, which tells the framework to go to that
phase.

Watch our game in action (now with phases). Notice that you can only draw cards in the first
phase, and you can only play cards in the second phase.

```react
<iframe class='plain' src='snippets/phases-2' height='350' scrolling='no' title='example' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe>
```

### Setup and Cleanup hooks

You can also run code automatically at the beginning or end of a phase. These are specified just like normal moves in `onBegin` and `onEnd`.

```js
phases: {
  phaseA: {
    onBegin: ({ G, ctx }) => { ... },
    onEnd: ({ G, ctx }) => { ... },
  },
};
```

?> Hooks like `onBegin` and `onEnd` are run only on the server in
multiplayer games. Moves, on the other hand, run on both client
and server. They are run on the client in order to facilitate
a lag-free experience, and are run on the server to calculate the
authoritative game state.

### Moving between Phases

#### Using events

The two primary ways of moving between phases are by calling the
following events:

1. `endPhase`: This ends the current phase and returns the game
   to a state where no phase is active. If the phase specifies a
   `next` option, then the game will move into that phase instead.

2. `setPhase`: This ends the current phase and moves the game into
   the phase specified by the argument.


#### Using an `endIf` condition

You can also end a phase by returning a truthy value from its
`endIf` method:

```js
phases: {
  phaseA: {
    next: 'phaseB',
    endIf: ({ G, ctx }) => true,
  },
  phaseB: { ... },
},
```

!> Whenever a phase ends, the current player's turn is first ended automatically.


### Setting the next phase dynamically

Instead of setting a phase’s `next` option with a string, you can
provide a function that will return the next phase based on game
state at the end of the phase:

```js
phases: {
  phaseA: {
    next: ({ G }) => {
      return G.condition ? 'phaseC' : 'phaseB';
    },
  },
  phaseB: { ... },
  phaseC: { ... },
},
```


### Override Behavior

As observed above, a phase can specify its own `moves` section
which comes into effect when the phase is active. This `moves`
section completely replaces the global `moves` section
for the duration of the phase. The moves may have the
same name as their global equivalents, but they are not related
to them in any way.

A phase can similarly also override the `turn` section. You will
typically do this if you want to use a different
[Turn Order](turn-order.md) during the phase.

## plugins

# Plugins

The Plugin API allows you to create objects that expose
custom functionality to [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/).
You can create wrappers around moves, add API's to `ctx` etc.

### Creating a Plugin

A plugin is an object that contains the following fields.

```js
{
  // Required.
  name: 'plugin-name',

  // Initialize the plugin's data.
  // This is stored in a special area of the state object
  // and not exposed to the move functions.
  setup: ({ G, ctx, game }) => data object,

  // Create an object that becomes available in `ctx`
  // under `ctx['plugin-name']`.
  // This is called at the beginning of a move or event.
  // This object will be held in memory until flush (below)
  // is called.
  api: ({ G, ctx, game, data, playerID }) => api object,

  // Return an updated version of data that is persisted
  // in the game's state object.
  flush: ({ G, ctx, game, data, api }) => data object,

  // Function that accepts a move / trigger function
  // and returns another function that wraps it. This
  // wrapper can modify G before passing it down to
  // the wrapped function. It is a good practice to
  // undo the change at the end of the call. 
  // `fnType` gives the type of hook being wrapped
  // and will be one of the `GameMethod` values —
  // import { GameMethod } from 'boardgame.io/core' 
  fnWrap: (fn, fnType) => ({ G, ...rest }, ...args) => {
    G = preprocess(G);
    G = fn({ G, ...rest }, ...args);
    if (fnType === GameMethod.TURN_ON_END) {
      // only run when wrapping a turn’s onEnd function
    }
    G = postprocess(G);
    return G;
  },

  // Function that allows the plugin to indicate that it
  // should not be run on the client. If it returns true,
  // the client will discard the state update and wait
  // for the master instead.
  noClient: ({ G, ctx, game, data, api }) => boolean,

  // Function that allows the plugin to indicate that the
  // current action should be declared invalid and cancelled.
  // If `isInvalid` returns an error message, the whole update
  // will be abandoned and an error returned to the client.
  isInvalid: ({ G, ctx, game, data, api }) => false | string,

  // Function that can filter `data` to hide secret state
  // before sending it to a specific client.
  // `playerID` could also be null or undefined for spectators.
  playerView: ({ G, ctx, game, data, playerID }) => filtered data object,
}
```

### Adding Plugins to Games

The list of plugins is specified in the game spec.

```js
import { PluginA, PluginB } from 'boardgame.io/plugins';

const game = {
  name: 'my-game',

  plugins: [PluginA, PluginB],

  // ...
};
```

?> Plugins are applied one after the other in the order
that they are specified (from left to right).

### Configuring Plugins

Some plugins may need a user to provide some configuration. The recommended way to do that is to design the plugin as a factory function that takes configuration as its arguments and returns a plugin object.

```js
import { ConfigurablePlugin } from './plugins';

const game = {
  name: 'my-game',
  plugins: [
    ConfigurablePlugin(options),
  ],
}
```

?> See `PluginPlayer` below for an example of this in practice.

### Available Plugins

#### PluginPlayer

```js
import { PluginPlayer } from 'boardgame.io/plugins';

// define a function to initialize each player’s state
const playerSetup = (playerID) => ({ ... });

// filter data returned to each client to hide secret state (OPTIONAL)
const playerView = (players, playerID) => ({
  [playerID]: players[playerID],
});

const game = {
  plugins: [
    // pass your function to the player plugin
    PluginPlayer({
      setup: playerSetup,
      playerView: playerView,
    }),
  ],
};
```

`PluginPlayer` makes it easy to manage player state.
It creates an object `players` that
stores state for individual players.  This object is
stored in the plugin's private storage area:

```
players: {
  '0': { ... },
  '1': { ... },
  '2': { ... },
  ...
}
```

The initial values of these states are determined by the `setup` function in its options object, which creates the state for a particular `playerID`.

The record associated with the current player can be accessed
via `ctx.player.get()`. If this is a 2 player game,
then the opponent's record is available using `ctx.player.opponent.get()`. These fields can be modified using their corresponding
`set()` versions.

```js
ctx.player.get() // Get the current player's record.
ctx.player.set() // Update the current player's record.
ctx.player.opponent.get() // Get the opponent player's record.
ctx.player.opponent.set() // Update the opponent player's record.
```

## random

# Randomness

Many games allow moves whose outcome depends on shuffled cards or rolled dice.
Take e.g. the game [Yahtzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee).
A player rolls dice, chooses some, rolls another time, chooses some more, and does a final dice roll.
Depending on the face-up sides the player now must choose where they will score.

This poses interesting challenges regarding the implementation.

- **AI**. Randomness makes games interesting since you cannot predict the future, but it
  needs to be controlled in order for allowing games that can be replayed exactly (e.g. for AI purposes).

- **<abbr title="Pseudo-Random Number Generator">PRNG</abbr> State**.
  The game runs on both the server and client.
  All code and data on the client can be viewed and used to a player's advantage.
  If a client could predict the next random numbers that are to be generated, the future flow of a game stops being unpredictable.
  The library must not allow such a scenario. The RNG and its state must stay on the server.

- **Pure Functions**. The library is built using Redux. This is important for games since each move is a [reducer](https://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html),
  and thus must be pure. Calling `Math.random()` and other functions that
  maintain external state would make the game logic impure and not idempotent.

### Using Randomness in Games

The object passed to moves and other game logic contains an object `random`,
which exposes a range of functions for generating randomness.

For example, the `random.D6` function is similar to rolling six-sided dice:

```js
{
  moves: {
    rollDie: ({ G, random }) => {
      G.dieRoll = random.D6(); // dieRoll = 1–6
    },

    rollThreeDice: ({ G, random }) => {
      G.diceRoll = random.D6(3); // diceRoll = [1–6, 1–6, 1–6]
    }
  },
}
```

You can see details for all the available random functions below.

### Seed

You can set the initial `seed` used for the random number generator
on your game object:

```js
const game = {
  seed: 42,
  // ...
};
```

?> `seed` can be either a string or a number.

## API Reference

### 1. Die

#### Arguments

1. `spotvalue` (_number_): The die dimension (_default: 6_).
2. `diceCount` (_number_): The number of dice to throw.

#### Returns

The die roll value (or an array of values if `diceCount` is greater than `1`).

#### Usage

```js
const game = {
  moves: {
    move({ random }) {
      const die = random.Die(6);      // die = 1-6
      const dice = random.Die(6, 3);  // dice = [1-6, 1-6, 1-6]
    },
  }
};
```

### 2. Number

Returns a random number between `0` and `1`.

#### Usage

```js
const game = {
  moves: {
    move({ random }) {
      const n = random.Number();
    },
  }
};
```

### 3. Shuffle

#### Arguments

1. `deck` (_array_): An array to shuffle.

#### Returns

The shuffled array.

#### Usage

```js
const game = {
  moves: {
    move({ G, random }) {
      G.deck = random.Shuffle(G.deck);
    },
  },
};
```

### 4. Wrappers

`D4`, `D6`, `D8`, `D10`, `D12` and `D20` are wrappers around
`Die(n)`.

#### Arguments

1. `diceCount` (_number_): The number of dice to throw.

#### Usage

```js
const game = {
  moves: {
    move({ random }) {
      const die = random.D6();
    },
  }
};
```

## secret-state

# Secret State

In some games you might need to hide information from
players or spectators. For example, you might not want to reveal the
hands of opponents in card games.

This is easily accomplished at the UI layer (by not
rendering secret information), but the framework also
provides support for not even sending such data to
the client.

In order to do this, use the `playerView` setting in
the game object. It accepts a function that receives an
object containing `G`, `ctx`, and `playerID`, and returns a version of `G`
that is stripped of any information that should be hidden
from that specific player.

```js
const game = {
  // `playerID` could also be null or undefined for spectators.
  playerView: ({ G, ctx, playerID }) => {
    return StripSecrets(G, playerID);
  },
  // ...
};
```

!> Make sure that you associate the game clients with individual
players (as discussed in the [Multiplayer](multiplayer.md) section).

### PlayerView.STRIP_SECRETS

The framework comes bundled with an implementation of `playerView`
that does the following:

- It removes a key named `secret` from `G`.
- If `G` contains a `players` object, it removes all keys except
  for the one that matches `playerID`.

```js
G: {
  secret: { ... },

  players: {
    '0': { ... },
    '1': { ... },
    '2': { ... },
  }
}
```

becomes the following for player `1`:

```js
G: {
  players: {
    '1': { ... },
  }
}
```

Usage:

```js
import { PlayerView } from 'boardgame.io/core';

const game = {
  // ...
  playerView: PlayerView.STRIP_SECRETS,
};
```

### Disabling moves that manipulate secret state on the client

Moves that manipulate secret state often cannot run on the client because
the client doesn't have all the necessary data to process such moves.
These can be marked as server-only by setting `client: false` on move:

```js
moves: {
  moveThatUsesSecret: {
    move: ({ G, random }) => {
      G.secret.value = random.Number();
    },

    client: false,
  }
}
```

## stages

# Stages

A stage is similar to a phase, except that it happens within a turn.
A turn can be subdivided into many stages, each allowing a different
set of moves during that stage.

Stages are also useful to allow more than one player to play during a turn.
By default, only the `currentPlayer` is allowed to make moves during a turn.
However, some game situations call for moves by other players. For example,
the `currentPlayer` might play a card that requires every other player in
the game to discard a card. These discards don't have to happen in any
particular order, and they're not really separate turns (the `currentPlayer`
can still play other cards before the turn finally ends). Stages are useful
in such situations.

Whenever one or more players enters a stage during a turn, then the framework
only allows moves from those players (rather than `currentPlayer`). The
players don't have to all be in the same stage either (each player can be
in their own stage). Each player that is in a stage is now considered an
"active" player that can make moves as allowed by the stage that they are in.

You can check `playerID` inside a move to figure out
which player made it. This may be necessary in situations
where multiple players are active (and could simultaneously make a move).

```js
const move = ({ G, ctx, playerID }) => {
  console.log(`move made by player ${playerID}`);
};
```

### Defining Stages

Stages are defined inside a `turn` section:

```js
const game = {
  moves: { ... },

  turn: {
    stages: {
      discard: {
        moves: { DiscardCard },
      },
    },
  },
};

```

The example above defines a single `discard` stage that players enter when they are
required to discard a card. The stage defines its own `moves` section which specifies
what moves a player in that stage can make. This `moves` section completely overrides
the global `moves` section for players in that stage (players are not allowed to make
any moves from the global `moves` section while they are in that stage). However, if
a stage does not contain a `moves` section, then players can make moves from the global `moves`.

!> A move defined in a stage can have the same name as a global move, but it isn't related to the global equivalent in any way.

### Entering Stages

A stage can be entered by calling the `setStage` event.
This takes the player that called the event into the specified stage:

```js
setStage('discard');
```

### Exiting Stages

Exiting a stage is performed by calling the `endStage` event.
This removes the player from the stage that they are currently
in and returns them to a state where they aren't in any stage.

```js
endStage();
```

It is possible to automatically take a player to another stage
when `endStage` is called. This is done by specifying a `next`
option in the stage config.

```js
stages: {
  A: { next: 'B' },
  B: { next: 'C' },
  C: { next: 'A' },
}
```

In the example above, `endStage` will cycle between the three
stages.

### Advanced

Sometimes you need to move a group of players into a stage
(as opposed to just the player that called the event).
We use the `setActivePlayers` event for this:

```js
setActivePlayers({
  // Move the current player to a stage.
  currentPlayer: 'stage-name',

  // Move every other player to a stage.
  others: 'stage-name',

  // Move all players to a stage.
  all: 'stage-name',

  // Enumerate the set of players and the stages that they
  // are in.
  value: {
    '0': 'stage-name',
    '1': 'stage-name',
    ...
  },

  // Prevents manual endStage before the player
  // has made the specified number of moves.
  minMoves: 1,

  // Calls endStage automatically after the player
  // has made the specified number of moves.
  maxMoves: 5,

  // This takes the stage configuration to the
  // value prior to this setActivePlayers call
  // once the set of active players becomes empty
  // (due to players either calling endStage or
  // maxMoves ending the stage for them).
  revert: true,

  // A next option will be used once the set of active players
  // becomes empty (either by using maxMoves or manually removing
  // players).
  // All options available inside setActivePlayers are available
  // inside next.
  next: { ... },
});
```

Let's go back to the example we discussed earlier where we
require every other player to discard a card when we play one:

```js
function PlayCard({ events }) {
  events.setActivePlayers({ others: 'discard', minMoves: 1, maxMoves: 1 });
}

const game = {
  moves: { PlayCard },
  turn: {
    stages: {
      discard: {
        moves: { Discard },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

```react
<iframe class='plain' src='snippets/stages-1' height='160' scrolling='no' title='example' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'></iframe>
```

#### Advanced Move Limits

Passing a `minMoves` argument to `setActivePlayers` forces all the
active players to make at least that number of moves before being able to
end the stage, but sometimes you might want to set different move limits 
for different players. For cases like this, `setStage` and `setActivePlayers` 
support long-form arguments:

```js
setStage({ stage: 'stage-name', minMoves: 3 });
```

```js
setActivePlayers({
  currentPlayer: { stage: 'stage-name', minMoves: 2 },
  others: { stage: 'stage-name', minMoves: 1 },
  value: {
    '0': { stage: 'stage-name', minMoves: 4 },
  },
});
```

Passing a `maxMoves` argument to `setActivePlayers` limits all the
active players to making that number of moves, but sometimes you might want
to set different move limits for different players. For cases like this,
`setStage` and `setActivePlayers` support long-form arguments:

```js
setStage({ stage: 'stage-name', maxMoves: 3 });
```

```js
setActivePlayers({
  currentPlayer: { stage: 'stage-name', maxMoves: 2 },
  others: { stage: 'stage-name', maxMoves: 1 },
  value: {
    '0': { stage: 'stage-name', maxMoves: 4 },
  },
});
```

### Stage.NULL

Sometimes you want to add a player to the set of active players
but don't want them to be in a specific stage. You can use `Stage.NULL`
for this:

```js
import { Stage } from 'boardgame.io/core';

// This allows any player to make a move, but doesn't restrict them to
// a particular stage.
setActivePlayers({ all: Stage.NULL });
```

There is also a convenient syntax to enumerate the players
that you want in the set of active players:

```js
// Players 0 and 3 are added to the set of active players,
// and neither is placed in a stage.
setActivePlayers(['0', '3']);
```

### Configuring active players at the beginning of a turn.

You can have `setActivePlayers` called automatically
at the beginning of the turn by adding an `activePlayers` section
to the `turn` config:

```js
turn: {
  activePlayers: { all: Stage.NULL },
}
```

### Presets

A number of `activePlayers` configurations are available as presets that you
can use directly:

```js
import { ActivePlayers } from 'boardgame.io/core';

turn: {
  activePlayers: ActivePlayers.ALL;
}
```

#### ALL

Equivalent to `{ all: Stage.NULL }`. Any player can play, and they
aren't restricted to any particular stage.

#### ALL_ONCE

Equivalent to `{ all: Stage.NULL, minMoves: 1, maxMoves: 1 }`. Any player can make
exactly one move before they are removed from the set of active players.

#### OTHERS

Similar to `ALL`, but excludes the current player from the set
of active players.

#### OTHERS_ONCE

Similar to `ALL_ONCE`, but excludes the current player from the set
of active players.

## storage

# Storage

**boardgame.io** is storage agnostic. Various adapters are
available that allow you to persist your game state in
different storage systems.

You can even write your [own adapter](/storage?id=writing-a-custom-adapter)
for a custom backend.

### Flatfile

First, install the necessary packages:

```
npm install node-persist
```

Then modify your server spec to indicate that you want to connect to a flatfile database:

```js
const { Server, FlatFile } = require('boardgame.io/server');
const { TicTacToe } = require('./game');

const server = Server({
  games: [TicTacToe],

  db: new FlatFile({
    dir: '/storage/directory',
    logging: (true/false),
    ttl: (optional, see node-persist docs),
  }),
});

server.run(8000);
```

### Other backends

#### Firebase

Instructions at https://github.com/delucis/bgio-firebase.

#### Azure Storage

Instructions at https://github.com/c-w/bgio-azure-storage.

#### Postgres

Instructions at https://github.com/janKir/bgio-postgres.

#### MongoDB

Coming soon (used to be supported but is not in sync with the
latest release).

### Caching

Depending on your set-up, you may want the server to cache some of the data,
reducing the load on your database and speeding up server responses.
[@boardgame.io/storage-cache](https://github.com/boardgameio/storage-cache) offers
a basic caching model compatible with any boardgame.io database connector.

### Writing a Custom Adapter

Create a class that implements the [StorageAPI.Async](https://github.com/boardgameio/boardgame.io/blob/main/src/server/db/base.ts) interface.

## testing

# Testing Strategies

### Unit Tests

Moves are just functions, so they lend themselves to unit testing.
A useful strategy is to implement each move as a standalone function
before passing them to the game object:

`Game.js`

```js
export function clickCell({ G, playerID }, id) {
  G.cells[id] = playerID;
}

export const TicTacToe = {
  moves: { clickCell },
  // ...
}
```

`Game.test.js`

```js
import { clickCell } from './Game';

it('should place the correct value in the cell', () => {
  // original state.
  const G = {
    cells: [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null],
  };

  // make move.
  clickCell({ G, playerID: '1' }, 3);

  // verify new state.
  expect(G).toEqual({
    cells: [null, null, null, '1', null, null, null, null, null],
  });
});
```

### Scenario Tests

Test your game logic in specific scenarios.

```js
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/client';
import { TicTacToe } from './Game';

it('should declare player 1 as the winner', () => {
  // set up a specific board scenario
  const TicTacToeCustomScenario = {
    ...TicTacToe,
    setup: () => ({
      cells: ['0', '0', null, '1', '1', null, null, null, null],
    }),
  };

  // initialize the client with your custom scenario
  const client = Client({
    game: TicTacToeCustomScenario,
  });

  // make some game moves
  client.moves.clickCell(8);
  client.moves.clickCell(5);

  // get the latest game state
  const { G, ctx } = client.getState();

  // the board should look like this now
  expect(G.cells).toEqual(['0', '0', null, '1', '1', '1', null, null, '0']);
  // player '1' should be declared the winner
  expect(ctx.gameover).toEqual({ winner: '1' });
});
```

?> Note that we imported the vanilla JavaScript client, not the
one from `boardgame.io/react`.

### Testing Randomness

If you are testing a move that uses the [Random API](/random), by definition
you can’t always expect the same result, making it harder to test. In this
case, you can use one of the following strategies.

#### Fixed PRNG seed

You can set `seed` in your game object. This will be used to initialise the
Random API’s internal state and you’ll see a predictable sequence of results
from calls to random API methods:

```js
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/client';

const Game = {
  moves: {
    rollDice: ({ G, random }) => {
      G.roll = random.D6();
    },
  },
};

it('updates G.roll with a random number', () => {
  const client = Client({
      // Set seed so PRNG always starts in same state
    game: { ...Game, seed: 'fixed-seed' },
  });
  client.moves.rollDice();
  const { G } = client.getState();
  expect(G.roll).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`4`);
});
```

#### Override Random API <small>`since v0.49.10`</small>

If you need to test specific random outcomes, you can override the Random
API entirely to allow complete control of the results of API methods.

```js
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/client';
import { MockRandom } from 'boardgame.io/testing';

// Create a mock of the random plugin, where the D6 method always returns 6.
// Any methods you don’t provide an implementation for will behave as usual.
const randomPlugin = MockRandom({
  D6: () => 6,
});

it ('rolls a six', () => {
  const client = Client({
    game: {
      ...Game,
      // Add the random plugin mock to the game’s plugins.
      plugins: [...(Game.plugins || []), randomPlugin]
    },
  });
  client.moves.rollDice();
  const { G } = client.getState();
  expect(G.roll).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`6`);
});
```

### Multiplayer Tests

Use the local multiplayer mode to simulate multiplayer interactions
in unit tests.

```js
it('multiplayer test', () => {
  const spec = {
    game: MyGame,
    multiplayer: Local(),
  };

  const p0 = Client({ ...spec, playerID: '0' });
  const p1 = Client({ ...spec, playerID: '1' });

  p0.start();
  p1.start();

  p0.moves.moveA();
  p0.events.endTurn();

  // Player 1's state reflects the moves made by Player 0.
  expect(p1.getState()).toEqual(...);

  p1.moves.moveA();
  p1.events.endTurn();

  ...
});
```

### Integration Tests

Test the application end-to-end from the UI layer's point of view.

In this case we use [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
to mount our React component and look for the TicTacToe board inside of it.
We then check the board is rendered and responds to user interaction as expected.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';
import App from './app';

describe('Tic-Tac-Toe', () => {
  const { container } = render(<App />);
  const cells = container.querySelectorAll('td');
  
  test('board is empty initially', () => {
    expect(cells).toHaveLength(9);
    for (const cell of cells) {
      expect(cell).toBeEmptyDOMElement();
    }
  });
  
  test('clicking a cell places player 0’s marker', () => {
    fireEvent.click(cells[5]);
    expect(cells[5]).toHaveTextContent('0');
  });
});
```

## turn-order

# Turn Order

The framework's default behavior is to pass the turn around
in a round-robin fashion. A player makes one or more moves
before triggering an `endTurn` event, which passes the turn
to the next player.

Turn order state is maintained in the following fields:

```js
ctx: {
  currentPlayer: '0',
  playOrder: ['0', '1', '2', ...],
  playOrderPos: 0,
}
```

##### `currentPlayer`

This is the owner of the current turn and the only player that
can normally make moves during the turn. You may also allow
additional players to make moves during the turn using [Stages](stages.md).

##### `playOrder`

The default value is `['0', '1', '2', ... ]`. You can think of this
as the order in which players sit down at the table. A round
robin turn order would move `currentPlayer` through this
list in order.

##### `playOrderPos`

An index into `playOrder`. It is the value that is updated
by the turn order policy in order to compute `currentPlayer`.
The default behavior is to just increment it in a round-robin
fashion. `currentPlayer` is just `playOrder[playOrderPos]`.

### Changing the Turn Order

Changing the game's turn order is accomplished by using the `order`
option inside the `turn` section of the game config:

```js
import { TurnOrder } from 'boardgame.io/core';

const game = {
  turn: {
    order: TurnOrder.ONCE,
  },
};
```

You will typically use one of the presets below. You may also
change the turn order at each phase of the game. See the guide
on [Phases](phases.md) for more details.

### Presets

#### DEFAULT

This is the default round-robin. It is used if you don't
specify any turn order.

#### RESET

This is similar to `DEFAULT`, but instead of incrementing
the previous position at the beginning of a phase, it
will always start from `0`.

#### CONTINUE

This is also similar to `DEFAULT`, but instead of incrementing
the previous position at the beginning of a phase, it will
start with the player who ended the previous phase.

#### ONCE

This is another round-robin, but it goes around only once.
After this, the phase ends automatically.

#### CUSTOM

Round-robin like `DEFAULT`, but sets `playOrder` to the provided
value.

```js
turn: {
  order: TurnOrder.CUSTOM(['1', '3']),
}
```

#### CUSTOM_FROM

Round-robin like `DEFAULT`, but sets `playOrder` to the value
in a specified field in `G`.

```js
turn: {
  order: TurnOrder.CUSTOM_FROM('property_in_G'),
}
```

### Ad Hoc

You can also specify the next player during the `endTurn` event.

```js
endTurn({ next: playerID });
```

This argument can also be the return value of `turn.endIf` and
works the same way.

Player `3` is made the new player in both examples below:

```js
function Move({ events }) {
  events.endTurn({ next: '3' });
}
```

```js
const game = {
  turn: {
    endIf: () => ({ next: '3' }),
  },
};
```

### Creating a Custom Turn Order

If the presets above aren't what you're looking for, you can
create a custom turn order from scratch:

```js
turn: {
  order: {
    // Get the initial value of playOrderPos.
    // This is called at the beginning of the phase.
    first: ({ G, ctx }) => 0,

    // Get the next value of playOrderPos.
    // This is called at the end of each turn.
    // The phase ends if this returns undefined.
    next: ({ G, ctx }) => (ctx.playOrderPos + 1) % ctx.numPlayers,

    // OPTIONAL:
    // Override the initial value of playOrder.
    // This is called at the beginning of the game / phase.
    playOrder: ({ G, ctx }) => [...],
  }
}
```

## tutorial

# Tutorial

This tutorial walks through a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

?> We’re going to be running commands from a terminal and using Node.js/npm.
   If you haven’t done that before, you might want to read [an introduction to the command line][cmd]
   and follow [the instructions on how to install Node][node]. You’ll also want
   a text editor to write code in like [VS Code][vsc] or [Atom][atom].

[node]: https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs
[cmd]: https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/
[vsc]: https://code.visualstudio.com/
[atom]: https://atom.io/



## Setup

We’re going to use ES2015 features like module [imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)
and the [object spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator)
syntax, so we’ll need to use some kind of build system to compile
our code for the browser.

This tutorial shows two different approaches: one using [React](https://reactjs.org/),
the other using basic browser APIs and compiling our app with
[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).
You can follow whichever you feel most comfortable with.

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Plain JS**

Let’s create a new Node project from the command line:

```
mkdir bgio-tutorial
cd bgio-tutorial
npm init --yes
```

?> These commands will make a new directory called `bgio-tutorial`,
   change to that directory, and initialise a new Node package.
   [Read more in the Node Package Manager docs.][pkgjson]

[pkgjson]: https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file#creating-a-default-packagejson-file

We’re going to add boardgame.io and also Parcel to help us build our app:

```
npm install boardgame.io
npm install --save-dev parcel-bundler
```


Now, let’s create the basic structure our project needs:


1. A JavaScript file for our web app at `src/App.js`.


2. A JavaScript file for our game definition at `src/Game.js`.


3. A basic HTML page that will load our app at `index.html`:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>boardgame.io Tutorial</title>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="app"></div>
      <script src="./src/App.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

Your project directory should now look like this:

    bgio-tutorial/
    ├── index.html
    ├── node_modules/
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── src/
        ├── App.js
        └── Game.js

Looking good? OK, let’s get started! 🚀

?> You can check out the complete code for this tutorial
and play around with it on CodeSandbox:<br/><br/>

### **React**

We’ll use the [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)
command line tool to initialize our React app and then add boardgame.io to it.

```
npx create-react-app bgio-tutorial
cd bgio-tutorial
npm install boardgame.io
```

While we’re here, let’s also create an empty JavaScript file for our game code:

```
touch src/Game.js
```

<!-- tabs:end -->



## Defining a Game

We define a game by creating an object whose contents
tell boardgame.io how your game works. More or less everything
is optional, so we can start simple and gradually add complexity.
To start, we’ll add a `setup` function, which will set the
initial value of the game state `G`, and a `moves` object
containing the moves that make up the game.

A move is a function that updates `G` to the desired new state.
It receives an object containing various fields
as its first argument. This object includes the game state `G` and
`ctx` — an object managed by boardgame.io that contains game metadata.
It also includes `playerID`, which identifies the player making the move.
After the object containing `G` and `ctx`, moves can receive arbitrary arguments
that you pass in when making the move.

In Tic-Tac-Toe, we only have one type of move and we will
name it `clickCell`. It will take the ID of the cell that was clicked
and update that cell with the ID of the player who clicked it.

Let’s put this together in our `src/Game.js` file to start
defining our game:

```js
export const TicTacToe = {
  setup: () => ({ cells: Array(9).fill(null) }),

  moves: {
    clickCell: ({ G, playerID }, id) => {
      G.cells[id] = playerID;
    },
  },
};
```

?> The `setup` function also receives an object as its first argument
like moves. This is useful if you need to customize the initial
state based on some field in `ctx` — the number of players, for example —
but we don't need that for Tic-Tac-Toe.



## Creating a Client

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Plain JS**

We’ll start by creating a class to manage our web app’s logic in `src/App.js`.

In the class’s constructor we’ll create a boardgame.io client
and call its `start` method to run it.

```js
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/client';
import { TicTacToe } from './Game';

class TicTacToeClient {
  constructor() {
    this.client = Client({ game: TicTacToe });
    this.client.start();
  }
}

const app = new TicTacToeClient();
```

Let’s also add a script to `package.json` to make serving the web app simpler
and a [browserslist string](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) to
indicate the browsers we want to support:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html --open"
  },
  "browserslist": "defaults and supports async-functions"
}
```
?> By dropping support for browsers that don’t support async functions, we don’t
   need to worry about including the `regenerator-runtime` polyfill. If you need to
   support older browsers, you can skip adding `browserslist`, but may need to
   include the polyfill manually.

You can now serve the app from the command line by running:

```
npm start
```

### **React**

Replace the contents of `src/App.js` with

```js
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/react';
import { TicTacToe } from './Game';

const App = Client({ game: TicTacToe });

export default App;
```

You can now serve the app from the command line by running:

```
npm start
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

Although we haven’t built any UI yet, boardgame.io renders a Debug Panel.
This panel means we can already play our Tic-Tac-Toe game!

You can make a move by clicking on `clickCell` on the
Debug Panel, entering a number between `0` and `8`, and pressing
**Enter**. The current player will make a move on the chosen
cell. The number you enter is the `id` passed to the `clickCell` function as
the first argument after `G` and `ctx`. Notice how the
`cells` array on the Debug Panel updates as you make moves. You
can end the turn by clicking `endTurn` and pressing **Enter**. The next call to
`clickCell` will result in a “1” in the chosen cell instead of a “0”.

```react
<iframe class='react' src='snippets/example-1' height='760' scrolling='no' title='example' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'></iframe>
```


?> You can turn off the Debug Panel by passing `debug: false`
in the `Client` config.



## Game Improvements

### Validating Moves

So far, if a player calls `clickCell` for a cell that is already filled,
it will be overwritten. Let’s prevent that by updating `clickCell`
to let us know that a move is invalid if the selected cell isn’t `null`.

Moves can let the framework know they are invalid by returning a
special constant which we import into `src/Game.js`:

```js
import { INVALID_MOVE } from 'boardgame.io/core';
```

Now we can return `INVALID_MOVE` from `clickCell`:

```js
clickCell: ({ G, playerID }, id) => {
  if (G.cells[id] !== null) {
    return INVALID_MOVE;
  }
  G.cells[id] = playerID;
}
```

### Managing Turns

In the Debug Panel we clicked `endTurn` to pass the turn
to the next player after making a move. We could do this from our
client code too: make a move, then end the turn. This could be flexible
because a player could choose when to end their turn, but in
Tic-Tac-Toe we know that the turn should always end when a move is made.

There are several different ways to manage turns in boardgame.io.
We’ll use the `maxMoves` option in our game definition to tell
the framework to automatically end a player’s turn after a single
move has been made, as well as the `minMoves` option, so players
*have* to make a move and can't just `endTurn`.

```js
export const TicTacToe = {
  setup: () => { /* ... */ },

  turn: {
    minMoves: 1,
    maxMoves: 1,
  },

  moves: { /* ... */ },
}
```

?> You can learn more in the [Turn Order](turn-order.md)
    and [Events](events.md) guides.

### Victory Condition

The Tic-Tac-Toe game we have so far doesn't really ever end.
Let's keep track of a winner in case one player wins the game.

First, let’s declare two helper functions in `src/Game.js`
to test the `cells` array with:

```js
// Return true if `cells` is in a winning configuration.
function IsVictory(cells) {
  const positions = [
    [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [0, 3, 6],
    [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]
  ];

  const isRowComplete = row => {
    const symbols = row.map(i => cells[i]);
    return symbols.every(i => i !== null && i === symbols[0]);
  };

  return positions.map(isRowComplete).some(i => i === true);
}

// Return true if all `cells` are occupied.
function IsDraw(cells) {
  return cells.filter(c => c === null).length === 0;
}
```

Now, we add an `endIf` method to our game.
This method will be called each time our state updates to
check if the game is over.

```js
export const TicTacToe = {
  // setup, moves, etc.

  endIf: ({ G, ctx }) => {
    if (IsVictory(G.cells)) {
      return { winner: ctx.currentPlayer };
    }
    if (IsDraw(G.cells)) {
      return { draw: true };
    }
  },
};
```

?> `endIf` takes a function that determines if
the game is over. If it returns anything at all, the game ends and
the return value is available at `ctx.gameover`.



## Building a Board

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Plain JS**

You can build your game board with your preferred UI tools.
This example will use basic JavaScript, but you should be able
to adapt this approach to many other frameworks.

To start with, let’s add a `createBoard` method to our
`TicTacToeClient` and call it in the constructor. This will inject
the required DOM structure for our board into the web page.
To know where to insert our board UI, we’ll pass in an
element when instantiating the class.

We’ll also add an `attachListeners` method. This will
set up our board cells so that they trigger the `clickCell`
move when they are clicked.

```js
class TicTacToeClient {
  constructor(rootElement) {
    this.client = Client({ game: TicTacToe });
    this.client.start();
    this.rootElement = rootElement;
    this.createBoard();
    this.attachListeners();
  }

  createBoard() {
    // Create cells in rows for the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
    const rows = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      const cells = [];
      for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        const id = 3 * i + j;
        cells.push(`<td class="cell" data-id="${id}"></td>`);
      }
      rows.push(`<tr>${cells.join('')}</tr>`);
    }

    // Add the HTML to our app <div>.
    // We’ll use the empty <p> to display the game winner later.
    this.rootElement.innerHTML = `
      <table>${rows.join('')}</table>
      <p class="winner"></p>
    `;
  }

  attachListeners() {
    // This event handler will read the cell id from a cell’s
    // `data-id` attribute and make the `clickCell` move.
    const handleCellClick = event => {
      const id = parseInt(event.target.dataset.id);
      this.client.moves.clickCell(id);
    };
    // Attach the event listener to each of the board cells.
    const cells = this.rootElement.querySelectorAll('.cell');
    cells.forEach(cell => {
      cell.onclick = handleCellClick;
    });
  }
}

const appElement = document.getElementById('app');
const app = new TicTacToeClient(appElement);
```

You probably won’t see anything just yet, because all the cells are empty.
Let’s fix that by adding a style for the cells to `index.html`:

```html
<style>
  .cell {
    border: 1px solid #555;
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    line-height: 50px;
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>
```

Now you should see an empty Tic-Tac-Toe board!
But there’s still one thing missing. If you click
on the board cells, you should see `G.cells` update
in the Debug Panel, but the board itself doesn’t change.
We need to add a way to refresh the board every time
boardgame.io’s state changes.

Let’s do that by writing an `update` method for our `TicTacToeClient`
class and subscribing to the boardgame.io state:

```js
class TicTacToeClient {
  constructor() {
    // As before, but we also subscribe to the client:
    this.client.subscribe(state => this.update(state));
  }

  createBoard() { /* ... */ }

  attachListeners() { /* ... */ }

  update(state) {
    // Get all the board cells.
    const cells = this.rootElement.querySelectorAll('.cell');
    // Update cells to display the values in game state.
    cells.forEach(cell => {
      const cellId = parseInt(cell.dataset.id);
      const cellValue = state.G.cells[cellId];
      cell.textContent = cellValue !== null ? cellValue : '';
    });
    // Get the gameover message element.
    const messageEl = this.rootElement.querySelector('.winner');
    // Update the element to show a winner if any.
    if (state.ctx.gameover) {
      messageEl.textContent =
        state.ctx.gameover.winner !== undefined
          ? 'Winner: ' + state.ctx.gameover.winner
          : 'Draw!';
    } else {
      messageEl.textContent = '';
    }
  }
}
```

Here are the key things to remember:

- You can trigger the moves defined in your game definition
  by calling `client.moves['moveName']`.


- You can register callbacks for every state change using `client.subscribe`.

### **React**

React can be a good fit for board games because
it provides a declarative API to translate objects
to UI elements. To create a board we need to translate
the game state `G` into actual cells that are clickable.

Let’s create a new file at `src/Board.js`:

```js
import React from 'react';

export function TicTacToeBoard({ ctx, G, moves }) {
  const onClick = (id) => moves.clickCell(id);

  let winner = '';
  if (ctx.gameover) {
    winner =
      ctx.gameover.winner !== undefined ? (
        <div id="winner">Winner: {ctx.gameover.winner}</div>
      ) : (
        <div id="winner">Draw!</div>
      );
  }

  const cellStyle = {
    border: '1px solid #555',
    width: '50px',
    height: '50px',
    lineHeight: '50px',
    textAlign: 'center',
  };

  let tbody = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    let cells = [];
    for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
      const id = 3 * i + j;
      cells.push(
        <td key={id}>
          {G.cells[id] ? (
            <div style={cellStyle}>{G.cells[id]}</div>
          ) : (
            <button style={cellStyle} onClick={() => onClick(id)} />
          )}
        </td>
      );
    }
    tbody.push(<tr key={i}>{cells}</tr>);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <table id="board">
        <tbody>{tbody}</tbody>
      </table>
      {winner}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The important bit to pay attention to is about how to
dispatch moves. We have the following code in our click
handler:

```js
moves.clickCell(id);
```

- `moves` is passed in your component’s props by the framework and
  contains functions to dispatch your game’s moves. `props.moves.clickCell`
  dispatches the `clickCell` move, and any data passed in is made
  available in the move handler.


Now, we pass the board component to our `Client` in `src/App.js`:

```js
import { TicTacToeBoard } from './Board';

const App = Client({
  game: TicTacToe,
  board: TicTacToeBoard,
});

export default App;
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

And there you have it. A basic tic-tac-toe game!

```react
<iframe class='react' src='snippets/example-2' height='760' scrolling='no' title='example' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'></iframe>
```

?> You can press <kbd>1</kbd> (or click on the button next to “reset”)
   to reset the state of the game and start over.



## Bots

In this section we will show you how to add a bot that is
capable of playing your game. We need to tell the
bot what moves are allowed in the game, and it will find moves that
tend to produce winning results.

To do this, add an `ai` section to the game definition.
The `enumerate` function should return an array of possible
moves, so in our case it returns a `clickCell` move for every
empty cell.

```js
export const TicTacToe = {
  // setup, turn, moves, endIf ...

  ai: {
    enumerate: (G, ctx) => {
      let moves = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        if (G.cells[i] === null) {
          moves.push({ move: 'clickCell', args: [i] });
        }
      }
      return moves;
    },
  },
};
```

That's it! Now that you can visit the AI section of the Debug Panel:

- `play` causes the bot to calculate and make a single move
  (shortcut: <kbd>2</kbd>)

- `simulate` causes the bot to play the entire game by itself
  (shortcut: <kbd>3</kbd>)

`play` helps you combine moves that you make yourself
and bot moves. For example, you can make
some manual moves to get two in a row and then verify that
the bot makes a block.

```react
<iframe class='react' src='snippets/example-3' height='760' scrolling='no' title='example' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'></iframe>
```

?> The bot uses [MCTS](https://nicolodavis.com/blog/tic-tac-toe/) under the
hood to explore the game tree and find good moves. The default uses
1000 iterations per move.  This can be configured to adjust the
bot's playing strength.

The framework will come bundled with a few different bot algorithms, and an advanced
version of MCTS that will allow you to specify a set of objectives to optimize for.
For example, at any given point in the game you can tell the bot to gather resources
in the short term and wage wars in the late stages. You just tell the bot what to do
and it will figure out the right combination of moves to make it happen!

Detailed documentation about all this is coming soon. Adding bots to games for actual
networked play (as opposed to merely simulating moves) is also in the works.

## typescript

# TypeScript

boardgame.io includes type definitions for TypeScript.

### Basic usage

```typescript
// Game.ts
import type { Game, Move } from "boardgame.io";

### React

React components must include boardgame.io-specific properties, so extend your
props from `BoardProps`. By passing your game state type to `BoardProps`,
you’ll get the correct typing for `G` in your board component.

```typescript
// Board.tsx
import type { BoardProps } from 'boardgame.io/react';
import type { MyGameState } from './Game.ts'

interface MyGameProps extends BoardProps<MyGameState> {
  // Additional custom properties for your component
}

export function MyGameBoard(props: MyGameProps) {
  // Your game board
}
```

Read more about [Client](api/Client.md) in the reference. No special typing should be required.

```typescript
// App.tsx
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/react';

import { MyGame } from './Game';
import { MyGameBoard } from './Board';

const App = Client({
  game: MyGame,
  board: MyGameBoard,
});
export default App;
```

## undo

# Undo / Redo

boardgame.io comes with built-in support to undo / redo
moves in the current turn. This is a common pattern in
games that allow a player to make multiple moves per turn,
and can be a useful feature to allow the player to experiment
with different move combinations (and seeing what they do)
before committing to one. You can disable this feature by
setting `disableUndo` to true in the game config.

### Usage

You can call the `undo` and `redo` functions from the client.

<!-- tabs:start -->
#### **Plain JS**

The methods are attached to a `Client` instance:

```js
client.undo();
client.redo();
```

#### **React**

The methods are passed in your board component’s `props`:

```js
props.undo();
props.redo();
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

### Restricting Undoable Moves

In case you just want specific moves to be undoable
(to prevent peeking at cards or rerolling of dice, for example),
you can use the long-form move syntax, which specifies the
move as an object rather than a function. The `undoable` bit
indicates whether the move can be undone:

```js
const game = {
  moves: {
    rollDice: {
      move: ({ G, ctx }) => {},
      undoable: false,
    },

    playCard: ({ G, ctx }) => {},
  },
};
```

In the example above, `playCard` will be undoable, but not `rollDice`.
